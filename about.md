Hi, I'm Sophie!  

I currently work as a Customer Success Manager at  [Kaptivo](https://kaptivo.com), a startup tech company in the San Francisco Bay Area.  

In 2018, I graduated from San Francisco State University with a Bachelor's in Computer Science.  I also received a minor in Business Administration and Mathematics.

During my time at SFSU, I ran for the Women's Cross Country and Track & Field team.  

In my free time, i enjoy running, rock climbing, and traveling.
