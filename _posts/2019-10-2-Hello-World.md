Hi everyone!  This is my personal website showcasing my current projects.  

My goal is to continuously improve this site by building up existing projects, adding new projects, and enhacing the site itself.

This is my personal website showcasing my resume and links to my work.  
My goal is to continuously edit this site by improving various functions, like adding HTTPS, and add more content to display my skills.

I created this site using Google Domains, Github pages, and the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
