title: Welcome to my site!

Hi everyone!  This is my personal website showcasing my current projects.  

My goal is to continuously improve this site by building up existing projects, adding new projects, and enhacing the site itself.

I created this site using Google Domains, Github pages, and the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
